I'm a final-year PhD student from the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.
My research mainly focuses on federated learning and edge computing. 
I received my B.S. degree in computer science and the M.S. degree in cyberspace security from Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wanchun Dou from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.
During my PhD, I was also fortunate to be advised by Assoc. Prof. Xuyun Zhang at Macquarie University.
