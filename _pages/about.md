I'm a final-year PhD student from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.
My research focuses on federated learning and edge computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wanchun Dou from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.
During my PhD, I was also fortunate to be advised by Assoc. Prof. Xuyun Zhang at Macquarie University.
