I'm a final-year PhD student from the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and the M.S. degree in Cyberspace Security from Nanjing University of Science and Technology.
My research mainly focuses on Federated Learning and Edge Computing. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wanchun Dou from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.
During my PhD, I was also fortunate to be advised by Assoc. Prof. Xuyun Zhang at Macquarie University.
